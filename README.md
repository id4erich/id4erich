Hello

My name is Youngbok.
I run a small software development company in Korea.

Our company develops civil engineering design programs, as well as Unity subway line design and spillway design programs.

In the smart farm field, we've developed a full-stack system for pollination smart beehives and migratory beekeeping smart beehives, and are providing it to the National Institute of Agricultural Sciences. This project is non-profit.

Our other business is screen golf. It's based on the Unity Engine, and we've recently been developing and supplying park golf programs to avoid the slump in the screen golf industry.

Does this give you an idea of ​​my age? Yes, I'm old.

I'm nearing retirement age. I'm enjoying development and persevering with this business, but I'm increasingly feeling the limitations. While I haven't achieved anything significant, I'm satisfied with the interesting experiences I've gained in various fields.

Despite this diverse experience, I go to work every day looking forward to new opportunities.

Our company's slogan is:

"Fearless in Innovation, Unmatched in Challenge."

I hope you too can take on challenges without fear...;)
